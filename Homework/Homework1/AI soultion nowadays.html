    <h2>Discover the Best AI Solution for Your Processing Needs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong> Endpoint </strong> -- Process data directly on the endpoint to extend the benefits of AI to all connected devices.</li>
        <li><strong> Edge </strong> -- Leverage high-performance compute on 5G and IoT gateways to minimize latency and reduce costs. ​</li>
        <li><strong> Cloud </strong> -- Enable innovation in the cloud with power-efficient Hyperscale and High Performance Computing (HPC).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The reason of these solution: </h3>
    <p>Compute power in IoT devices is increasing while costs decline, allowing developers to leverage machine learning across innovative applications executed on the smallest, most power- and cost-constrained systems.</p>
    <p>By distributing compute resources along the edge rather than in data centers hundreds or thousands of miles away, data can be processed close to the source, improving efficiency, enhancing security and unlocking new opportunities.</p>
    <p>As workload densities increase, data processing becomes increasingly important in maintaining performance, power efficiency, and a low total cost of ownership (TCO)—all essential for achieving streamlined business operations. ​​</p>

    <h2>Industry Solutions: AI-Driven Innovation</h2>

    <h4><strong>Smart Home</strong></h4>
    <p>AI technologies are setting the standard for today’s smart homes by connecting objects like smoke detectors, digital TVs, refrigerators, lighting, and heating systems, and using sensor technology to gather continuous data from them.​</p>
